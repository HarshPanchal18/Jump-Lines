* Jump Lines is a plugin for JetBrains IDEs that allows you to navigate your code more efficiently by jumping multiple lines at once.

* With Jump Lines, you can move your cursor up or down by a number of lines with a single keystroke, saving you time and reducing the strain on your hands.

* To use Jump Lines, simply search `Jumping Lines` in plugin and tap on install. The plugin assigned a keybinding `Ctrl+Shift+K` to "Go Downside" and `Ctrl+Shift+Comma` to "Go upside".

<!--* You can customize the number of lines to jump by modifying the plugin settings. -->

* Jump Lines works with all JetBrains IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Jump Lines can help you navigate your code more efficiently and improve your productivity.
